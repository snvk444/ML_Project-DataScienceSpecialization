## Introduction
Assignment is to understand the data about the activity done by 6 participants. Goal is to predict the manner
in which they did the excercise. Variable considered is the "classe" variable.


Below is the study design I followed to determine the predictors.  
1. Read the input data.  
2. Split the data into training and testing data.  
3. Understand the relationship between different variables in the data with 'classe' variable.  
4. Identify a few variables that show a high dependency on the variability if 'classe' variable.  
5. Train a few models with classe and the few vaiables that are considered in the previous step.  
6. Do model comparison to identify which model gives better accuracy.
